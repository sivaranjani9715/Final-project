# Final-project

This repository features a range of projects related to social media.

The First project, 'Ratings of Guvi Courses', is focused on helping the Guvi company 
predict the ratings that their courses will receive from learners. By doing so, the company
can identify areas where improvements are needed to enhance the overall learning experience
for their learners.

Lastly, the 'Instagram Influencers' project consists of a series of questions that can help
improve various data processing techniques.

Overall, this repository provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring 
the intersection of social media and data analytics. Each project offers unique insights 
and tools for analyzing and optimizing your social media strategy.
